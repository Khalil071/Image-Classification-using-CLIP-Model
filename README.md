Image Classification using CLIP Model

Overview

This project implements a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model for detecting and classifying images based on natural language prompts. The model used is:

CLIPModel: CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

CLIPProcessor: Used for preprocessing images and text before feeding them into the model.

The CLIP model learns a joint representation of images and text, enabling zero-shot classification without explicit training on specific labels.

Dataset

The model can be used with any image dataset, with classification based on a set of predefined text labels. If using a specific dataset, ensure it is structured as follows:

├── dataset/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── category_1/
│   │   ├── category_2/
│   │   ├── ...

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/clip-image-classification.git
cd clip-image-classification

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Usage

Run inference using the pre-trained CLIP model:

python src/clip_model.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --labels "label1, label2, label3"

Fine-Tuning (Optional)

If dataset-specific training is required, fine-tune CLIP with:

python src/train.py --dataset dataset/

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on a test set:

python src/evaluate.py --dataset dataset/

Results

Results include accuracy, similarity scores between images and text labels, and visualizations. Detailed analysis is available in the Jupyter notebooks under notebooks/.

Future Improvements

Experimenting with larger CLIP models for better performance.

Fine-tuning CLIP on domain-specific datasets.

Building an interactive web app for real-time image classification.
